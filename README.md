## Background

DNA (Deoxyribonucleic acid) is the hereditary material in organisms, carrying the genetic instructions for development, functioning, growth, and reproduction. DNA sequence analysis is a fundamental aspect of genomics and bioinformatics, providing crucial insights into genetic variation, evolution, and gene function.

This project simulates several key aspects of DNA sequence analysis:

1. **GC Content Analysis**: The GC content is the percentage of nitrogenous bases in a DNA molecule that are either guanine (G) or cytosine (C). This measure is important in various biological processes and can indicate functional regions of the genome. High GC content is often associated with increased gene density and regulatory elements.

2. **Motif Identification**: DNA motifs are short, recurring patterns in DNA that are presumed to have biological significance. They can represent protein binding sites, splice sites, or other functional elements. Identifying these motifs helps in understanding gene regulation and protein-DNA interactions.

3. **k-mer Frequency Analysis**: k-mers are subsequences of length k contained within a biological sequence. Analyzing k-mer frequencies can reveal patterns in DNA sequences, aid in genome assembly, and contribute to the identification of functional or evolutionary constraints on sequences.

4. **Sequence Clustering**: This technique groups DNA sequences based on their similarity. In this project, we use GC content and sequence length as features for clustering. This can help in identifying related sequences or in understanding the diversity within a set of sequences.

These analyses provide a multi-faceted view of DNA sequences, offering insights into their composition, potential functional elements, and relationships among sequences. Such information is crucial in various fields of biological research, including genomics, evolutionary biology, and medical genetics.

GenomicInsights simulates these analytical processes, providing a practical tool for researchers and students to explore fundamental concepts in DNA sequence analysis. While it doesn't replace advanced bioinformatics pipelines, it serves as an educational and exploratory tool for understanding the basics of genomic data analysis.

## Features

- GC content analysis
- Motif identification
- k-mer frequency analysis
- Sequence clustering
- Result visualization
  
## Usage

1. Prepare a FASTA file with a DNA sequences and save it as `sequences.fasta` in the `data` directory.
2. Run the main script:
```
python scripts/run_analysis.py
```

3. Check the output files in the project directory for graphs and analyses.

## Example

```python
from src.analysis.dna_analyzer import DNAAnalyzer

analyzer = DNAAnalyzer("data/sequences.fasta")
gc_content = analyzer.get_gc_content(analyzer.sequences["Sequence1"])
print(f"GC content of Sequence1: {gc_content}%")
```
