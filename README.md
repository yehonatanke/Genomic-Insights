## Genomic Analysis 
A DNA sequence analysis for sequence characteristics, GC content, and motif structures.

Aspects of DNA sequence analysis:

- **GC Content Analysis**
- **Motif Identification**: Identifying motifs for understanding gene regulation and protein-DNA interactions.
- **k-mer Frequency Analysis**: k-mers are subsequences of length k contained within a biological sequence.
- **Sequence Clustering**: Groups DNA sequences based on their similarity. We use GC content and sequence length as features for clustering.
- **Variation Analysis** 
- **Structural Variation Detection:** Identify larger rearrangements.
